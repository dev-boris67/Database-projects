## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon Aurora?

Amazon Aurora is a fully managed, high-performance relational database engine developed by AWS and why it is useful because of its High Performance, Scalability, High Availability and much more

### How I used Amazon Aurora in this project

In this project, I used Amazon Aurora to Create an Amazon Aurora Database and connect it with Amazon EC2!

One thing I didn't expect in this project was for it to be an easy and handy project as it was.

### This project took me...

It took me 40 minutes to complete this project

## In the first part of my project...

### Creating an Aurora Cluster

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which are collections of rows and columns. 

Aurora is a good choice when we needed something large-scale, with peak performance and uptime.

## Halfway through I stopped!

I stopped creating my Aurora database because I need to connect it to an EC2 instance and I haven't even created an EC2 instance. Let's do that first, then come back.

### Features of my EC2 instance

I created a new key pair for my EC2 instance because I will need to log into, add, change, or update how my EC2 instance is running

When I created my EC2 instance, I took particular note of Public IPv4 DNS and Key pair name. Both are critical for accessing our EC2 instance.

## Then I could finish setting up my database

Aurora Database uses clusters because clusters in are  groups of database copies that work together so my data is always available..
